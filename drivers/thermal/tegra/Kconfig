config TEGRA124_SOCTHERM
	bool "Tegra124 SOCTHERM thermal management"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA_124_SOC
	select TEGRA_SOCTHERM
	help
	  Enable this option for integrated thermal management support on NVIDIA
	  Tegra124 systems-on-chip. The driver supports four thermal zones
	  (CPU, GPU, MEM, PLLX). Cooling devices can be bound to the thermal
	  zones to manage temperatures. This option is also required for the
	  emergency thermal reset (thermtrip) feature to function.

config TEGRA132_SOCTHERM
	bool "Tegra132 SOCTHERM thermal management"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA_132_SOC
	select TEGRA_SOCTHERM
	help
	  Enable this option for integrated thermal management support on NVIDIA
	  Tegra132 systems-on-chip. The driver supports four thermal zones
	  (CPU, GPU, MEM, PLLX). Cooling devices can be bound to the thermal
	  zones to manage temperatures. This option is also required for the
	  emergency thermal reset (thermtrip) feature to function.

config TEGRA210_SOCTHERM
	bool "Tegra210 SOCTHERM thermal management"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA_210_SOC
	select TEGRA_SOCTHERM
	help
	  Enable this option for integrated thermal management support on NVIDIA
	  Tegra210 systems-on-chip. The driver supports four thermal zones
	  (CPU, GPU, MEM, PLLX). Cooling devices can be bound to the thermal
	  zones to manage temperatures. This option is also required for the
	  emergency thermal reset (thermtrip) feature to function.

config TEGRA_THERM_EST
	bool "Tegra thermal estimator driver"
	depends on THERMAL_OF && THERMAL=y
	default n
	help
	  Tegra thermal driver which estimates temperature based
	  off of the weighted sum of a sequence of readings from
	  other sensors. The weights can be customized on a per-platform
	  basis.

config TEGRA_DRAM_THERMAL
	bool "Tegra DRAM thermal monitoring driver"
	depends on TEGRA210_EMC
	default y
	help
	  Enable this option for the DRAM thermal monitoring driver.

config TEGRA_DFLL_THERMAL_REACTION
	bool "Tegra DFLL thermal reaction driver"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA_124_SOC || ARCH_TEGRA_210_SOC
	help
	  Enable this to add the ability to automatically adjust the
	  DFLL's minimum voltage floor, based on the SoC temperature.
	  As the SoC temperature increases, the minimum voltage floor
	  can decrease, reducing energy consumption.

config TEGRA_THERMAL_THROTTLE
	bool "Enable throttling of Tegra CPU speed on overtemp"
	depends on THERMAL
	depends on (ARCH_TEGRA_124_SOC || ARCH_TEGRA_132_SOC || ARCH_TEGRA_210_SOC)
	default y
	help
	  Enable this to add Tegra thermal governors that alter the
	  CPU/GPU speed and the rates of c3bus, sclk, and emc clocks.
	  This keeps the temperature and performance stable and prevents
	  overheating.
